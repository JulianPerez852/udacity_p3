###Model Details:
####Julián David Pérez Hincapipé created the model. It is a Random Forest classifier using the default hyperparameters in scikit-learn 1.0.2
###Intended Use:
####Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Adult" dataset.
###Metrics
####The model was evaluated using Accuracy Recall and FBeta with 0.77 , 0.64 and 0.68 respectively
###Data
####The data was obtanied from the UCI machine learning repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income). Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))
Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.
###Bias
####This model represent a lot of american, white, men, so the data set is unbalanced in this terms and it is posible that the data set had bias so the model is not 100% reliable
